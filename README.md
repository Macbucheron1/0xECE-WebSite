# 0xECE Web Tech Project

This is the repository for the Web tech course at ECE Paris. It contains the Client side in which you can basically find all of the project. There is also Api file containing the lab we have done in class.

Here are the steps to contribute to the project:

1. Modify the files.
2. Run `npm test` to test the application for both frontend and backend.
3. Commit changes using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
4. Tag new versions or labs using `git tag`.
5. Push your changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure to test the application before pushing your changes.
